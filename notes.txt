Supervised Learning
    - Most common form on machine learning is supervised learning
    - Algorithm learns the relationship between a features matrix and a target vector 
        + Feature = A measurable property
        + Target = The outcome wanted to predict
    - The goal is to create a model that can predict the target given the features

Two Types of Supervised Learning:
    - Classification
        + Predicts a discrete value
        + Example: Is this a cat or a dog?
    - Regression
        + Predicts a continuous value
        + Example: How much will this house sell for?

Logistic Regression Models:
    - Model used for classification
    - Can be used for tasks like classifying flowers into species or predicting a tumor as benign or malignant
    - The model outputs a probability between 0 and 1
    - Outcome depends on availability and quality of data
    - Advantages
        + Model training and predictions are relatively fast
        + No tuning is usually required
        + Performs will with a small number of observations
        + Outputs well-calibrated predicted probabilities
    - Disadvantages
        + Performance is (generally) not competitive with the best supervised learning methods
        + Can only learn linear relationships
        + Can't automatically learn feature interactions
